Hey! Saw your thread about [topic].

We just launched Bitcoin Writer - Google Docs but on BSV.
You seem like you'd appreciate owning your content forever.

Free month for you: CODE2025

Worth checking out? [link]
```

**LinkedIn Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're in the blockchain space. We just solved a problem you might have - document management that's actually decentralized.

Bitcoin Writer = Google Docs + BSV blockchain.

30% off for fellow blockchain folks: LINKEDIN30

## üí™ Motivation & Mindset

### Daily Affirmations
- "Every 'no' gets me closer to a 'yes'"
- "I'm building the future of documents"
- "BSV actually scales - my competitors can't say that"
- "$10K MRR is just the beginning"

### When You Feel Like Quitting
Remember:
1. Google Docs makes BILLIONS doing this worse
2. You have unfair advantages (BSV, Open source controversy)
3. First $10K is hardest, next $100K is easier
4. You're 30 days away from changing your life

### The Vision
```
Day 30: $10K MRR
Day 90: $50K MRR
Day 365: $500K MRR
Day 730: Acquisition offer
```

---

## üöÄ LET'S FUCKING GO!

Start with Stripe integration TODAY. Not tomorrow. Not "later". TODAY.

The market is waiting. Your future customers are struggling with shitty document tools right now. You have the solution.

Ship it. Charge for it. Iterate based on feedback.

**Your only job for 30 days**: Get people to pay you $29/month.

Everything else is a distraction.

Now stop reading and start building! üí™

---

*P.S. - Document your journey. The story of getting to $10K MRR will be worth more than $10K in content marketing value.*
